Node js is asynchronous
Because nodejs is asynchronous we have to use await while reading the data


npm - node package manager

nodemon always looks for index.js

nodemodules will have all the necessary data and is very huge. 
To ignore files that are large into github we can add .gitignore and mention that file.

Next time if we want to clone this repository in another computer , 
after cloning we need to run npm install so that it wil install all necessary packages from package.json into node modules
